This is a personal project I built to help me search memes I have saved
from  the Internet.

I also built this project to gain a deeper understanding on how Spring Boot,
Spring Security, Spring Session, Spring Data JPA, Spring AI, AWS SDK for Java,
Lombok, Hibernate and a bunch of other Java libraries work to build a scalable,
fully functioning web application.

If this application is useful or interesting to you, consider giving it a
star on GitHub.

This application comes with a frontend web UI available [here](https://github.com/arvl130/mmm-ui).

## Features

- Full Text Search with PostgreSQL [`tsvector`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html)
- AI Tag Suggestions with [Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)
- Authentication with Session management with [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) and [Spring Session](https://spring.io/projects/spring-session)
